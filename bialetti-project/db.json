                "description": "Perfetto Moka Irresistibile coffee is the result of the encounter between the skilful art of Bialetti’s master coffee roasters and the creative flair of Dolce&Gabbana.
                The fine quality blend of 80% Arabica and 20% Robusta makes Perfetto Moka Irresistibile a coffee with a rounded, delicate taste, in which the broad bouquet of floral and fruity notes mingles with the mouth-watering ones of hazelnut and cocoa, in a sophisticated fusion of flavours typical of Italian tradition.",
